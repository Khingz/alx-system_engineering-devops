**Postmortem: Incident of Web Stack Outage**

**Summary of Issue:** - **Time:** 
  - Start Time: 11:45 AM UTC on November 12, 2023
  - End Time: 11:12 UTC on November 12, 2023
- **Result:**
  - A 30% rise in unsuccessful user login attempts was caused by the outage that impacted the user authentication service.
**Root Cause:** - Intermittent problems in routing authentication requests to the backend servers were caused by an error in the load balancer setup.

**Timeline:** - **08:45 AM UTC: Issue Detection** - An anomalous surge in authentication failures was discovered by an automatic monitoring alert.
**08:50 AM UTC: Preliminary Examine** - To find any problems, the operations team started looking at the authentication service logs.
**09:15 AM UTC: Inaccurate Route** - At first, slow queries were suspected, and database efficiency was the main focus. Database metrics, however, displayed typical behavior.
**Emergency: 09:45 AM UTC** - Since it appeared that the problem was with the network or load balancing, the situation was reported to the infrastructure team.
**10:15 AM UTC: Load Balancer Examination** - The infrastructure team found that the load balancer parameters were incorrectly configured, resulting in sporadic failures while trying to route traffic to the authentication servers.
- **10:30 AM UTC: Verified Root Cause** - It was determined that the load balancer's misconfiguration was the main reason why the authentication attempts failed.
**11:00 AM UTC: Resolution** - The load balancer configurations were adjusted, allowing the authentication servers to receive regular traffic flow again.
**11:30 AM UTC: Incident Closure** - The incident was formally closed after monitoring revealed a notable decrease in authentication failures.
**Root Cause and Resolution:** - **Root Cause:** - Incorrect authentication request routing due to load balancer misconfiguration resulted in sporadic failures.
**Resolution:** - The load balancer parameters were adjusted to guarantee that incoming authentication requests were distributed properly, hence correcting the misconfiguration.

**Preventive and Corrective Actions:** - **To Enhance/Fix:** - Frequent audits of load balancer configurations to identify inconsistencies.
  - Improve error rates and load balancer performance monitoring.
  - After configuration changes, automate testing to ensure the integrity of the authentication service.
**Assignments:** - **Time:**
    Examine all load balancer configurations for all services in detail.
    - Add more load balancer health monitoring checks to the system.
  **In the near term:**
    - Create and implement a playbook to quickly address load balancer misconfigurations.
    - Teach the operations team how to recognize and handle problems with load balancers.
  **Length of time:**
    Investigate failover and redundancy strategies for vital services to reduce the number of single points of failure.
    - Test the incident response procedure on a regular basis for scenarios that are similar.

This incident emphasizes how crucial it is to have ongoing surveillance, quick detection, and a clearly defined incident response procedure. By strengthening the system against such problems in the future, the corrective actions hope to provide a more dependable and robust web stack.
